There are many ways to contribute to this project:

* Report bugs/wishes to the issue list at https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon/issues
* Directly edit the source code using git. If you need help with this, please let us know.

Compiling the Source
--------------------
You are going to need:

* The latest Rhino5 WIP (http://www.rhino3d.com/nr.htm)
* Visual C# 2010

Steps:

* Get the source code by downloading everything as a zip or using git

I'm going to need to come up with better instructions on compiling and using the dll, but in a nutshell you should be able to debug into the RhinoCommon source code by:
1. rename the shipping RhinoCommon.dll to something like RhinoCommon.dll.original
2. place the RhinoCommon.dll and pdb that gets compiled by this project in the Rhino5 system directory
